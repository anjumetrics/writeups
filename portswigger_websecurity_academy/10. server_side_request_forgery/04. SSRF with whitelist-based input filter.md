## SSRF with whitelist-based input filter

**Title:** SSRF with whitelist-based input filter. [Go](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-whitelist-filter)

**Description:** This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://localhost/admin` and delete the user `carlos`. The developer has deployed an anti-SSRF defense you will need to bypass.
 
## Preface

Some applications only allow inputs that match, a whitelist of permitted values. The filter may look for a match at the beginning of the input, or contained within in it. You may be able to bypass this filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.

The URL specification contains a number of features that are likely to be overlooked when URLs implement ad-hoc parsing and validation using this method:

- You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the @ character. For example: `https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host`

- You can use the `#` character to indicate a URL fragment. For example: `https://evil-host#expected-host`

- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example: `https://expected-host.evil-host`

- You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that performs the back-end HTTP request. You can also try double-encoding characters; some servers recursively URL-decode the input they receive, which can lead to further discrepancies.

- You can use combinations of these techniques together.

## Methodology

### Finding the vulnerable parameter

In this particular lab we are interested in stock check feature.

### My Thought

We intercepted "Check stock" request in Burp Suite, and sent it to Burp Repeater. Then changed the URL in the `stockApi` parameter to `http://127.0.0.1/` and observed that the application is parsing the URL, extracting the hostname, and validating it against a whitelist. Changeing the URL to `http://username@stock.weliketoshop.net/` and observed that this is accepted, indicating that the URL parser supports embedded credentials.

"External stock check host must be stock.weliketoshop.net"
```
After appending a `#` to the username and we observed that the URL is now rejected. Double-URL encode the `#` to %2523 and observed the extremely suspicious "Internal Server Error" response, indicating that the server may have attempted to connect to "username". To access the admin interface and delete the target user, we changed the URL to:
`http://localhost:80%2523@stock.weliketoshop.net/admin/delete?username=carlos`
